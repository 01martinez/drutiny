Redirect rules should be refactored to take advantage of regular expressions if possible. Otherwise the redirect module should be added to the site and all of the redirects in the .htaccess file should be moved into the Drupal site. Although these redirects will then require a Drupal bootstrap in order to fulfill the request, Varnish will be able to cache the redirect once it has been made once as long as there is a maximum age set on the site.');
